## "I don't know what to write about!"

Finding the right topic is hard ‚Äì we know that. If you'd like to write for the BloomReach Developer blog but aren't quite sure about what to write about and need some inspiration, check out [the type of topics we would like to see blog posts about](https://github.com/bloomreach/contribution-program/issues) in this repository. They are labeled by their respective technologies for easy filtering and searching.

## How do I get started?

So you have an idea on what to write about and are totally stoked to get started? Open a new issue or comment on an existing one, and someone from **our developer relations team will reach out to you to discuss if your topic is a good fit**. If your topic is selected, we will move your story to [the project board](https://github.com/bloomreach/contribution-program/projects/1) and help you with everything you need.

Once you started writing, we'll make sure your topic is marked as `in progress` to avoid duplicate work.

### Create an outline to stay focused

Once your article is moved to `in progress`, we'd like you to first write an outline. Writing an article can sometimes be trickier than you think. That's why we think [a structured outline](./OUTLINE.md) will help you find the best possible narrative and stay focused in your writing.
